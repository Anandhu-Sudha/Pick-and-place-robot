Since I only had limited access to 3D printing but I wanted to create a pick n place robot arm. The possible option I had was try to replicate the 3D structure on some materials I have access to, there was some Forex sheet lying around and I tried to make the robotic arms with this sheet. I couldn't finish the project due to lack of time, components & budget. But here's the project with the Claw part. 

First prototype of Claw:

Pretty simple and Basic thought. But it can hardly hold a crushed paper ball.

Second prototype of Claw:

I surfed some more in the internet and got a 3D printing file of a Claw mechanism and tried to make it. My craftwork with things like this will end-up rough but my dad is quite a craftsman, so he helped me made this.

It was working fine

For this claw part i used an sg90 Micro servo. Things started going sideways after this part, sg90 servos were not good to handle the job of the fist part for rotating the entire claw mechanism. So an mg90 servo is used, that's also sorted. Soon after building the rest of the arm, these small servos couldn't handle the arm part , so had to buy big ones. Mg995 servos were used, and finishes the entire structure. I tested it separately and it was working fine but due to this much weight the whole arm was studdering a lot, Tried ro fix it several times but after endless hours i slowly began to lose interest in this and i left things there unfinished.

Someday when the time comes i'll try to fix it.

The final look of the Robotic Arm ðŸ‘‡
